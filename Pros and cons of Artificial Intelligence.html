The machines and robots used in this field are so complex that they can be used to explore the seabed. Intelligent robots can also be sent to explore space because they are made of metal and are more difficult to maintain in space.</h3></td>
            <td><h3>Artificial intelligence is replacing many skilled jobs, and this is how some people will lose their jobs. For example, many robots have completed work on the assembly line. In addition, there are these new types of driverless cars that can replace millions of human drivers, such as taxi or bus drivers.</h3></td>

Moreover, they have no emotions when thinking, which is why they make the right decision without making mistakes.</h3></td>
